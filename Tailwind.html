        <p class="">There are 12 zodiac signs, and each sign has its own strengths and weaknesses, its own
          specific
          traits, desires and attitude towards life and people. By analyzing the projection of the position of
          planets, and the Sun and the Moon on the Ecliptic at the moment of birth. Astrology can give us a
          glimpse of
          a person's basic characteristics, preferences, flaws and fears.</p>
        <p>The concept of the zodiac originated in Babylonian astrology, and was later influenced by Hellenistic
          culture. According to astrology, celestial phenomena relate to human activity on the principle of
          "as
          above,
          so below", so that the signs are held to represent characteristic modes of expression. Modern
          discoveries
          about the true nature of celestial objects have undermined the theoretical basis for assigning
          meaning
          to
          astrological signs, and empirical scientific investigation has shown that predictions and
          recommendations
          based on these systems are not accurate. Astrology is generally regarded as pseudoscience.</p>

        <p>Aquarius-born are shy and quiet , but on the other hand they can be eccentric and energetic. However,
          in
          both
          cases, they are deep thinkers and highly intellectual people who love helping others. They are able
          to
          see
          without prejudice, on both sides, which makes them people who can easily solve problems.

          Although they can easily adapt to the energy that surrounds them, Aquarius-born have a deep need to
          be
          some
          time alone and away from everything, in order to restore power. People born under the Aquarius sign,
          look at
          the world as a place full of possibilities.</p>
        <p>Aquarius is an air sign, and as such, uses his mind at every opportunity. If there is no mental
          stimulation,
          they are bored and lack a motivation to achieve the best result.</p>
        <p>The ruling planet of Aquarius, Uranus has a timid, abrupt and sometimes aggressive nature, but it
          also
          gives
          Aquarius visionary quality. They are capable of perceiving the future and they know exactly what
          they
          want
          to be doing five or ten years from now.</p>
        <p>The biggest problem for Aquarius-born is the feeling that they are limited or constrained. Because of
          the
          desire for freedom and equality for all, they will always strive to ensure freedom of speech and
          movement.
          Aquarius-born have a reputation for being cold and insensitive persons, but this is just their
          defence
          mechanism against premature intimacy. They need to learn to trust others and express their emotions
          in a
          healthy way.</p>

          Date range: March 21 - April 19</p>
        <p>As the first sign in the zodiac, the presence of Aries always marks the beginning of something
          energetic
          and
          turbulent. They are continuously looking for dynamic, speed and competition, always being the first
          in
          everything - from work to social gatherings. Thanks to its ruling planet Mars and the fact it
          belongs to
          the
          element of Fire (just like Leo and Sagittarius), Aries is one of the most active zodiac signs. It is
          in
          their nature to take action, sometimes before they think about it well.

        </p>
        <p>
          The Sun in such high dignity gives them excellent organizational skills, so you'll rarely meet an
          Aries
          who
          isn't capable of finishing several things at once, often before lunch break! Their challenges show
          when
          they
          get impatient, aggressive and vent anger pointing it to other people. Strong personalities born
          under
          this
          sign have a task to fight for their goals, embracing togetherness and teamwork through this
          incarnation.
        </p>
        <p>Aries rules the head and leads with the head, often literally walking head first, leaning forwards
          for
          speed
          and focus. Its representatives are naturally brave and rarely afraid of trial and risk. They possess
          youthful strength and energy, regardless of their age and quickly perform any given tasks.</p>

          Greatest Overall Compatibility: Capricorn, Taurus

          Lucky Numbers: 2, 3, 15, 20

          Date range: June 21 - July 22</p>
        <p>Deeply intuitive and sentimental, Cancer can be one of the most challenging zodiac signs to get to
          know.
          They
          are very emotional and sensitive, and care deeply about matters of the family and their home. Cancer
          is
          sympathetic and attached to people they keep close. Those born with their Sun in Cancer are very
          loyal
          and
          able to empathize with other people's pain and suffering.</p>
        <p>The sign of Cancer belongs to the element of Water, just like Scorpio and Pisces. Guided by emotion
          and
          their
          heart, they could have a hard time blending into the world around them. Being ruled by the Moon,
          phases
          of
          the lunar cycle deepen their internal mysteries and create fleeting emotional patterns that are
          beyond
          their
          control. As children, they don't have enough coping and defensive mechanisms for the outer world,
          and
          have
          to be approached with care and understanding, for that is what they give in return.</p>
        <p>Lack of patience or even love will manifest through mood swings later in life, and even selfishness,
          self-pity or manipulation. They are quick to help others, just as they are quick to avoid conflict,
          and
          rarely benefit from close combat of any kind, always choosing to hit someone stronger, bigger, or
          more
          powerful than they imagined. When at peace with their life choices, Cancer representatives will be
          happy
          and
          content to be surrounded by a loving family and harmony in their home.</p>

          Lucky Numbers: 4, 8, 13, 22

          Date range: December 22 - January 19</p>
        <p>Capricorn is a sign that represents time and responsibility, and its representatives are traditional
          and
          often very serious by nature. These individuals possess an inner state of independence that enables
          significant progress both in their personal and professional lives. They are masters of self-control
          and
          have the ability to lead the way, make solid and realistic plans, and manage many people who work
          for
          them
          at any time. They will learn from their mistakes and get to the top based solely on their experience
          and
          expertise.</p>
        <p>Belonging to the element of Earth , like Taurus and Virgo, this is the last sign in the trio of
          practicality
          and grounding. Not only do they focus on the material world, but they have the ability to use the
          most
          out
          of it. Unfortunately, this element also makes them stiff and sometimes too stubborn to move from one
          perspective or point in a relationship. They have a hard time accepting differences of other people
          that
          are
          too far from their character, and out of fear might try to impose their traditional values
          aggressively.
        </p>
        <p>Saturn is the ruling planet of Capricorn, and this planet represents restrictions of all kinds. Its
          influence
          makes these people practical and responsible, but also cold, distant and unforgiving, prone to the
          feeling
          of guilt and turned to the past. They need to learn to forgive in order to make their own life
          lighter
          and
          more positive.</p>

        <p>Expressive and quick-witted, Gemini represents two different personalities in one and you will never
          be
          sure
          which one you will face. They are sociable, communicative and ready for fun, with a tendency to
          suddenly
          get
          serious, thoughtful and restless. They are fascinated with the world itself, extremely curious, with
          a
          constant feeling that there is not enough time to experience everything they want to see.</p>
        <p>The sign of Gemini belongs to the element of Air, accompanying Libra and Aquarius, and this connects
          it
          to
          all aspects of the mind. It is ruled by Mercury, the planet that represents communication, writing,
          and
          movement. People born under this Sun sign often have a feeling that their other half is missing, so
          they
          are
          forever seeking new friends, mentors, colleagues and people to talk to.</p>
        <p>Gemini's changeable and open mind makes them excellent artists, especially writers and journalists,
          and
          their
          skills and flexibility make them shine in trade, driving and team sports. This is a versatile,
          inquisitive,
          fun loving sign, born with a wish to experience everything there is out there, in the world. This
          makes
          their character inspiring, and never boring.</p>

          Date range: July 23 - August 22</p>
        <p>People born under the sign of Leo are natural born leaders. They are dramatic, creative,
          self-confident,
          dominant and extremely difficult to resist, able to achieve anything they want to in any area of
          life
          they
          commit to. There is a specific strength to a Leo and their "king of the jungle" status. Leo often
          has
          many
          friends for they are generous and loyal. Self-confident and attractive, this is a Sun sign capable
          of
          uniting different groups of people and leading them as one towards a shared cause, and their healthy
          sense
          of humor makes collaboration with other people even easier.</p>
        <p>Leo belongs to the element of Fire, just like Aries and Sagittarius. This makes them warmhearted, in
          love
          with life, trying to laugh and have a good time. Able to use their mind to solve even the most
          difficult
          problems, they will easily take initiative in resolving various complicated situations. Ruled by the
          Sun,
          Leo worships this fiery entity in the sky, quite literally as well as metaphorically. They are in
          search
          for
          self-awareness and in constant growth of ego. Aware of their desires and personality, they can
          easily
          ask
          for everything they need, but could just as easily unconsciously neglect the needs of other people
          in
          their
          chase for personal gain or status. When a Leo representative becomes too fond and attached to their
          achievements and the way other people see them, they become an easy target, ready to be taken down.

        </p>
        <p>Leo - the Lion in the Cave The story of the Lion always speaks of bravery. This is an animal fearless
          and
          impossible to challenge, hurt or destroy, their only weaknesses being fear and aggression towards
          those
          they
          confront. Living in a cave, a Lion always needs to have one, nesting and finding comfort in hard
          times.
          However, they should never stay there for long. With their head high, they have to face others with
          dignity
          and respect, never raising a voice, a hand, or a weapon, bravely walking through the forest they
          rule.

        <p>People born under the sign of Libra are peaceful, fair, and they hate being alone. Partnership is
          very
          important for them, as their mirror and someone giving them the ability to be the mirror themselves.
          These
          individuals are fascinated by balance and symmetry, they are in a constant chase for justice and
          equality,
          realizing through life that the only thing that should be truly important to themselves in their own
          inner
          core of personality. This is someone ready to do nearly anything to avoid conflict, keeping the
          peace
          whenever possible</p>
        <p>The sign of Libra is an Air sign, set between Gemini and Aquarius, giving these individuals constant
          mental
          stimuli, strong intellect and a keen mind. They will be inspired by good books, insurmountable
          discussions
          and people who have a lot to say. Each Libra representative has to be careful when talking to other
          people,
          for when they are forced to decide about something that is coming their way, or to choose sides,
          they
          suddenly realize that they might be in the wrong place and surrounded by wrong people. No partner
          should
          make them forget that they have their own opinion.</p>
        <p>Planet ruling the sign of Libra is Venus, making these people great lovers but also fond of
          expensive,
          material things. Their lives need to be enriched by music, art, and beautiful places they get a
          chance
          to
          visit.</p>

        <p>Pisces are very friendly, so they often find themselves in a company of very different people. Pisces
          are
          selfless, they are always willing to help others, without hoping to get anything back.

          Pisces is a Water sign and as such this zodiac sign is characterized by empathy and expressed
          emotional
          capacity.</p>
        <p>Their ruling planet is Neptune, so Pisces are more intuitive than others and have an artistic talent.
          Neptune
          is connected to music, so Pisces reveal music preferences in the earliest stages of life. They are
          generous,
          compassionate and extremely faithful and caring.</p>
        <p>People born under the Pisces sign have an intuitive understanding of the life cycle and thus achieve
          the
          best
          emotional relationship with other beings.</p>
        <p>Pisces-born are known by their wisdom, but under the influence of Uranus, Pisces sometimes can take
          the
          role
          of a martyr, in order to catch the attention. Pisces are never judgmental and always forgiving. They
          are

        <p>Curious and energetic, Sagittarius is one of the biggest travelers among all zodiac signs. Their open
          mind
          and philosophical view motivates them to wander around the world in search of the meaning of life.

          Sagittarius is extrovert, optimistic and enthusiastic, and likes changes. Sagittarius-born are able
          to
          transform their thoughts into concrete actions and they will do anything to achieve their goals.</p>
        <p>Like the other fire signs, Sagittarius needs to be constantly in touch with the world to experience
          as
          much
          as possible. The ruling planet of Sagittarius is Jupiter, the largest planet of the zodiac. Their
          enthusiasm
          has no bounds, and therefore people born under the Sagittarius sign possess a great sense of humor
          and
          an
          intense curiosity.</p>
        <p>Freedom is their greatest treasure, because only then they can freely travel and explore different
          cultures
          and philosophies. Because of their honesty, Sagittarius-born are often impatient and tactless when
          they
          need
          to say or do something, so it's important to learn to express themselves in a tolerant and socially
          acceptable way.</p>

          until
          they find out the truth. Scorpio is a great leader, always aware of the situation and also features

        <p>Virgos are always paying attention to the smallest details and their deep sense of humanity makes
          them
          one of
          the most careful signs of the zodiac. Their methodical approach to life ensures that nothing is left
          to
          chance, and although they are often tender, their heart might be closed for the outer world. This is
          a
          sign
          often misunderstood, not because they lack the ability to express, but because they won’t accept
          their
          feelings as valid, true, or even relevant when opposed to reason. The symbolism behind the name
          speaks
          well
          of their nature, born with a feeling they are experiencing everything for the first time.</p>
        <p>Virgo is an Earth sign, fitting perfectly between Taurus and Capricorn. This will lead to a strong
          character,
          but one that prefers conservative, well-organized things and a lot of practicality in their everyday
          life.
          These individuals have an organized life, and even when they let go to chaos, their goals and dreams
          still
          have strictly defined borders in their mind. Constantly worried that they missed a detail that will
          be
          impossible to fix, they can get stuck in details, becoming overly critical and concerned about
          matters
          that
          nobody else seems to care much about.</p>
        <p>Since Mercury is the ruling planet of this sign, its representatives have a well-developed sense of
          speech
          and writing, as well as all other forms of communication. Many Virgos may choose to pursue a career
          as
          writers, journalists, and typists, but their need to serve others makes them feel good as
          caregivers, on
          a
          clear mission to help.

        <p>Practical and well-grounded, Taurus is the sign that harvests the fruits of labor. They feel the need
          to
          always be surrounded by love and beauty, turned to the material world, hedonism, and physical
          pleasures.
          People born with their Sun in Taurus are sensual and tactile, considering touch and taste the most
          important
          of all senses. Stable and conservative, this is one of the most reliable signs of the zodiac, ready
          to
          endure and stick to their choices until they reach the point of personal satisfaction.</p>
        <p>Taurus is an Earth sign, just like Virgo and Capricorn, and has the ability to see things from a
          grounded,
          practical and realistic perspective. They find it easy to make money and stay on same projects for
          years, or
          until they are completed. What we often see as stubbornness can be interpreted as commitment, and
          their
          ability to complete tasks whatever it takes is uncanny. This makes them excellent employees, great
          long-term
          friends and partners, always being there for people they love. Earthly note makes them
          overprotective,
          conservative, or materialistic at times, with views of the world founded on their love of money and
          wealth.

        </p>
        <p>The ruler of Taurus is Venus, the planet of love, attraction, beauty, satisfaction, creativity and
          gratitude.
          This tender nature will make Taurus an excellent cook, gardener, lover, and artist. They are loyal
          and
          don't
          like sudden changes, criticism or the chase of guilt people are often prone to, being somewhat
          dependable on
          other people and emotions they seem to be unable to let go of. Still, no matter their potential
          emotional
          challenge, these individuals have the ability to bring a practical voice of reason in any chaotic
          and
          unhealthy situation.</p>
